# ODTU-GUNAM-Internship-Report
Technical report of my summer internship at ODTÜ GÜNAM
**About the Internship**
During my internship at ODTÜ GÜNAM, I had the opportunity to observe and take part in several stages of high-efficiency solar cell manufacturing including:

- Surface Texturing  
- Doping (Phosphorus & Boron Diffusion)  
- PECVD-based Passivation  
- Metallization (Screen Printing, PVD, Plating)  
- Laser Contact Opening (LCO)  
- Firing Process  
- Electrical Testing and Characterization (Sinton, PL Imaging, Wafer Profiling, etc.)
Each process was documented in technical detail and supported by visuals, real equipment photos, and personal observations.

**What’s Inside**

Types of Solar Cells: Overview of SHJ, PERC, TOPCon, and IBC architectures  

Process Steps: Detailed explanations of texturing, doping, passivation, metallization, LCO, firing  

Characterization Tools: Sinton Lifetime Tester, Semilab PLI, WEP Wafer Profiler
